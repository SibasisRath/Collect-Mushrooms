# Collect-Mushrooms

Here I was trying to create a first-person controller. The basic game play is you need to move the player with "W, A, S, D, Space" keys (use mouse for direction/ look around) and jump to all platforms and collect mushrooms. The number of collected mushrooms will be shown on the screen. The graphics used in this projects are free assets from unity assets store.
